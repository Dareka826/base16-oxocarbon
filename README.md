# Base16 Oxocarbon

Base16 dark themes based on [nyoom-engineering's base16-oxocarbon](https://github.com/nyoom-engineering/base16-oxocarbon).

The dark version is optimized for base16-vim, while the dark-sh version is designed to match base16-shell standard colors better.

## Usage

Both of these themes follow the [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) format. You can either opt to manually use the provided hex codes, or use a [template](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-templates-source). These colors can also be used as a base for ports to editors and tooling.
